* DONE [#A] Daily budgeting in Ledger 2.6.1 does not work at all
  SCHEDULED: <2007-08-26 Sun> ARCHIVED: <2007-08-26 Sun>

    This was fixed by the bug fix for daily reporting.

* DONE [#B] Using the daily keyword for a ledger register report does not work
  SCHEDULED: <2007-08-26 Sun> ARCHIVED: <2007-08-26 Sun>
  - State "DONE"       [2007-08-26 Sun 03:16] \\
    This was fixed by correcting an error in datetime.cc where incrementing an
    interval by a day was actually doing it by a month.
  The following command only outputs monthly data, not daily data:
    ledger -p "daily from 2007/08/16" -s -l '! e/:USA:/' reg ^exp

* DONE [#B] The 'bal' command is giving me an assertion now

  - State "DONE"       [2007-08-26 Sun 03:01] \\
    Fixed this by changed the following code in amount.cc:
      amount_t val = leftprice - rightprice;
      if (val)
    to the following:
      int diff = leftprice.compare(rightprice);
      if (diff)
