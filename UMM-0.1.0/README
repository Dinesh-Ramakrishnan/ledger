Umm is an extremely minimal command-line program to read a plain-text
ledger file and report balance and other information. Although
minimal, it aims to be able to handle multiple accounts, currencies,
commodities, and securities. It doesn't abolutely force you to use
double-entry bookkeeping, although it tries to make it easy to do so.

Umm should have no dependencies other than a haskell compiler and
standard libraries, although I've not tested it with anything except
ghc. I've built it with both ghc 6.8.3 on an iMac G3 running OSX
10.3.9 and ghc 6.10.3 on an x86 running Ubuntu. You should be able to
build umm simply by running

	cabal configure && cabal build

For more information, build umm, then run "umm --help", and read the
output of that. Arguably, that info should be in this file... later.
Then look at the two files sample1.dat and sample2.dat; they are very
simple examples of ledgers.
